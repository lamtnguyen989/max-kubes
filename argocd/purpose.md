This directory here is just me documenting how (selected) Apps and Infrastructure are deployed and managed with ArgoCD in the `deployment-manifests` directory where as the name suggests, it is just recording the (parameters) of the Application manifests.

If I ever feel like it, I may start managaing ArgoCD with ArgoCD but just not today.
