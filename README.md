This repository will be mainly serve as a infrastructure as code (IaC) source for my personal server. The server is mainly orchastrated by [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) running on the secure, immutable [Talos Linux](https://www.talos.dev/) operating system (which is both great and also a nightmare at the same time).
